2. 
Create a stopwatch hook which takes size and step from outside. 
Write unit test for the same.
After completion, how can we use same hook for timer instead of stopwatch

one more coding exercise
/* Create timer hook that can simulate a countdown timer. 
The size or step of the timer should be customizable. 
It will provide us time to display along with play and pause functionality */
