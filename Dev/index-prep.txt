2. 
Create a stopwatch hook which takes size and step from outside. 
Write unit test for the same.
After completion, how can we use same hook for timer instead of stopwatch

one more coding exercise
/* Create timer hook that can simulate a countdown timer. 
The size or step of the timer should be customizable. 
It will provide us time to display along with play and pause functionality */

Diff btw Jest and Vitest
Vitest vs Jest
Diff btw CRA and vite (details)

1️⃣ Jest (the OG)
What it is

Facebook/Meta’s test runner,Been around forever,Default for Create React App

How it works

Runs in Node, Uses Babel or ts-jest to transform code, Slower startup, but very stable

Pros
Extremely mature
Huge ecosystem
Tons of tutorials & StackOverflow answers
Great for large, legacy projects

Cons
Slower (especially on big projects)
Config can get heavy
Not designed for Vite

What it is

Built by the Vite team
Designed for ESM-first projects

How it works
Runs using Vite’s dev server
Uses native ES modules
Near-instant startup ⚡

Pros

🔥 Very fast
Zero/low config
Perfect match for Vite + React
Jest-compatible API (describe, it, expect)

Cons

Newer (smaller ecosystem)
Some Jest plugins don’t work
A few Jest-only APIs missing
⚡ Speed difference (this is the real reason people switch)
Tool	Cold Start	Watch Mode
Jest	❌ Slower	😐 OK
Vitest	⚡ Instant	🚀 Super fast

Vitest feels like hot reload for tests.

🧪 API differences you actually feel
Mocking
Jest	Vitest
jest.mock()	vi.mock()
jest.fn()	vi.fn()
jest.spyOn()	vi.spyOn()


Use Vitest if:

You’re using Vite
You want fast tests
You like modern tooling

Use Jest if:

You’re on Create React App
You have an older codebase
You rely on Jest-only plugins

Jest = “Classic, stable, heavy”
Vitest = “Modern, fast, Vite-native”
